# Concurrent-Processing-and-Shared-Memory
CECS 326 Lab Fish, Pellets, &amp; Swim MIll 
In this project, we used a virtual machine in Linux and created a program in which shared memory was used simulatenously, resulting in multi-threading & semaphores.

## How does this work?
Three components:
- Fish: One fish that tries to gather as much pellets as possible.
- Pellets: Multiple pellets are dropped one grid space at a time.
- Swim Mill: Enables everything to work together. Running this would run the entire program.
